      <h2>- Brief intro to 3D Modeling</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>"In 3D computer graphics, 3D modeling is the process of developing a mathematical
          representation of any surface of an object (either inanimate or living) in three
          dimensions via specialized software. The product is called a 3D model. Someone who works
          with 3D models may be referred to as a 3D artist. It can be displayed as a two-dimensional
          image through a process called 3D rendering or used in a computer simulation of physical
          phenomena. The model can also be physically created using 3D printing devices."</li>
          <li>"Three-dimensional (3D) models represent a physical body using a collection of points
          in 3D space, connected by various geometric entities such as triangles, lines, curved
          surfaces, etc. Being a collection of data (points and other information), 3D models can be
          created by hand, algorithmically (procedural modeling), or scanned. Their surfaces may be
          further defined with texture mapping."</li>

      <h2>- My experiencing in 3D Modeling</h2>
      <p>
        I've been interested in 3D Modeling since a long time ago and finally got a chance to
        perfessionally learn about it during summer, 2019. After learning about 3D modeling and
        trained in 3D printing, I worked as an intern in a technology campany and mainly worked
        with 3D modeling and printing. It was a very exciting experience and I looking forward to
        learn more about 3D modeling in the future.

      <h3>Picture of one of my works</h3>
      <img src="img/jennysmodel.png" alt="Jenny's 3D Modeling work" />
      <p>This is a model of a traditional chinese styled architechture I designed. The major
         tools I used to build this model are <strong><em>3D one</em></strong> and <strong><em>
         Autodesk Maya</em></strong>. I also used Autodesk Maya to render the environment(light
         sources) to make the model look more relaistic.
